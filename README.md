# COMP3100: Distributed Systems

**Overview**

In my study of Distributed Systems, I traditionally understood it as a group of networked computers. However, I've come to understand it in a much wider sense today, including applications consisting of multiple processes. I studied the fundamentals of distributed systems from both a hardware perspective and a software perspective. This unit also provided me with some hands-on experience. The topics I covered include distributed systems principles(concurrecy and scheduling), paradigms (cloud computing, mobile computing and Internet of Things), architectures (client-server model, peer-to-peer model and distributed file systems) and techniques (shared memory and message-passing). This comprehensive study has given me a deep understanding of distributed systems.

**Technology Used**

- [Oracle VM Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Ubuntu 22.0.4 LTS Image](https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)
- [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

**Major Assignments**

- **Stage 1:** In the first stage, I designed and implemented a basic version of a client-side simulator. This included fundamental scheduling features and a simple job dispatcher.

- **Stage 2:** In the second stage, I designed and implemented a new scheduling algorithm. This was evaluated against a set of baseline algorithms, which included First-Fit (FF), Best-Fit (BF), and Worst-Fit (WF).
